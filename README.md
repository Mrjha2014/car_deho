Car Sales system is an application that computerizes the conventional car sale procedure which we are aware of. This is a windows based application. This helps in managing data related to buyers and sellers of the cars. Business reports can also be generated and viewed.

## Existing system
In the existing Car Sales System all the transactions are done in offline mode. The response is very slow and it is tough to retrieve particular data. Online data capture and modification is unavailable. The records that are maintained in MS Excel cannot be shared easily in multi user environment. Lack of security grants access to anyone which may lead to data misuse.

These are the limitations of existing system.

Every detail of a vehicle like manufacturer name, date of purchase, Kilo meters ran( in case of used vehicles), price, model etc  are recorded. This window based application is designed with user friendly computerized system with which a particular data can be retrieved with ease.
